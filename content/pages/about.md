## Hi 👋

![Developer.](/media/dev.gif)

My name is Hai DV (as you guess - Hai Developer). 

I 've started working as Software Engineer since 2017. A little boy with big love building & discovering sophisticated software architect of the large and distributed system.

```javascript
const me = {
    name: 'HaiDV',
    dob: '1995-05-28',
    languages: ['javascript', 'php', 'python'],
    socials: {
        facebook: 'https://facebook.com/dv.hai.77',
        github: 'https://github.com/GeminiWind',
        linkedin: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/dinh-van-hai/',
        mail: 'gemini.wind285@gmail.com'
    },
    interest: {
        game: 'League of Legend',
        blogs: [
                'https://martinfowler.com/',
                'https://dev.to/',
                'https://www.freecodecamp.org'
               ]    
    }
}
```

Thanks to my beloved friend - **NamDV** 👨🏻‍💻, my leader - **MinhPHL** 🤵🏻, my SA - **DongDH** 🕵️‍♂️ and others, I am on the right way to being full-stack developer. What I expect in my own is broading the knowledge and contributing what I've to make business product.
